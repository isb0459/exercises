The task is to put together a simple website in Python with two pages:
1) A page that requires no auth to access and which gives users a form for them to put in their email address. When the form is submitted a link to the 2nd page is sent to their email.
2) The 2nd should have the following properties:
2.1) Part of its address should be randomly generated and not easy to guess. In other words the only way to get to this page should be by going to the first page and submitting an email address.
2.2) The link should expire after 24 hours.

The spec is a bit rough so don't hesitate to ask us questions about it! Once you have it ready to go just sent us either a zipped git repo or a link to an online repo, and instructions on how to test the website locally.

See you Tuesday!
